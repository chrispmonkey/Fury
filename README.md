# Fury
##hACTOthon Project

#Overview
During the login process you state your job title, then give it imputs as to things that you currently do for your customer, and then based on some background (machine learning logic) it can give you suggestions to better do your job. It can display latest news articles about the customer you input, show things that you currently deliver to them, and then suggest things for you to deliver to them, as well as an estimated time that it might tkae to deliver the specified item (for example: an email, newsletter, call, etc.).

We need a proof of concept if it doesn't work, a visually appeasing proof of concept demonstration/presentation.

We need a drawing of how our app may look/function, a simpole storyboard with a few different screens. 

#Hack Roles
- Product Management 
 - Define the idea and unite the team behind the vision, define features and prioritize them. Provide feedback to the developers on their latest iteration.
 
- Business Architect
 - Present the value proposition for the idea, business case, and communicate the business requirements to the team. Provide ongoing feedback.
 
- Designer
 - Bring design thinking to your team’s solution concept. Create the UX wireframes for the developers.
 
- Program Management 
 - Coordinate your distributed multidisciplinary team.
 
- Configuration and Deployment Management 
 - Help make sure everyone is working with the latest artifacts in the latest development environment to avoid problems integrating their work.
 
- Marketing 
 - Take charge of the team video and presentation! Who will you share it with? How will you drum up excitement?
 
- Configuration Contributions
 - You can build a lot with configuration of IaaS and PaaS services. Take ownership of configuration and deployment.
 
- Data Architecture and Data Management 
 - You can do a lot of data manipulation and analysis without code using Azure Data Factory and Azure ML. If you have Data Architecture skills, you can define the data architecture for the developers.
 
Feel free to combine any and all of these roles! You are not required to fill these positions, but we just thought we would suggest it and give you and your team the best chance of success in your hacking!


#Requirements
- Slide Deck
 - this deck should show your solution and tell us what we need to know about your hack!
- Running Proof of Concept
 - at the end of all this hacking, we need to see a running proof of concept. Essentially, can you prove that your hack works?
- Video Outlining the Value Proposition
 - that’s right, you get to do a video! Hackers liked this last year because they got to speak and explain their hack rather than relying on a PowerPoint to do the talking for them! Your video should include the value proposition (Why is this valuable to our customers? Which customers?) and a business case (What would be the return on investment for a customer to fully-implement this? – how much revenue or cost savings could it generate, over what timeframe?). Your video should not exceed 10 minutes. The judges will cut each video off at 10 minutes, so be succinct!
- Side Note
 - Your team must be officially registered to participate in the hACTOthon and to have your hack considered by the judges. Full registration for each team, including all team members, must be completed before the end of hack week!
