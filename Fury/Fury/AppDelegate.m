    If you want to use the option Update badge value in Reach campaigns or if you want to use native push </SaaS/Reach API/Campaign format/Native Push> campaigns, you must let the Reach module manage the badge icon itself (it will automatically clear the application badge and also reset the value stored by Engagement every time the application is started or foregrounded). This is done by adding the following line after Reach module initialization: [reach setAutoBadgeEnabled:YES];
     
     If you want to handle Reach data push, you must let your Application delegate conform to the AEReachDataPushDelegate protocol. Add the following line after Reach module initialization: [reach setDataPushDelegate:self];
